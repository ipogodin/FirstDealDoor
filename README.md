# Last WAR 

## Overview

LastWar is a multi-module Minecraft plugin project for PaperMC 1.20, featuring two main components:

- **LastWarGame**: The main plugin for game orchestration, server selection, and player management.
- **LastWarGameLogic**: The core game logic, including flag mechanics, core management, and custom commands.

## Features

- Multi-world support for up to 27 game worlds.
- Custom commands for game control (`/endgame`, `/stop`, `/spawnflag`, `/resetcores`, `/dropFlag`).
- GUI interfaces for class, team, and server selection.
- Event listeners for player actions, world changes, and game events.
- Integration with ProtocolLib and BungeeCord for advanced server communication.

## Structure

- `LastwarGame/`: Main plugin module.
  - `src/main/java/org/lastwar_game/lastwargame/`: Source code for plugin orchestration, commands, GUI, listeners, and managers.
  - `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`: Plugin configuration and command registration.
  - `build.gradle`: Gradle build file, depends on `LastWarGameLogic` and PaperMC API.

- `LastWarGameLogic/`: Game logic module.
  - `src/main/java/org/example/gamelogic/lastwargamelogic/`: Source code for game mechanics, flag system, core management, and custom listeners.
  - `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`: Plugin configuration and command registration.
  - `build.gradle`: Gradle build file, depends on PaperMC API and ProtocolLib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build both modules using Gradle:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```
3. Place the generated JAR files from `LastwarGame/build/libs/` and `LastWarGameLogic/build/libs/` into your PaperMC serverâ€™s `plugins` folder.
4. Ensure ProtocolLib is installed on your server.

## Usage

- Use `/endgame` and `/stop` to control game sessions.
- Use `/spawnflag`, `/resetcores`, and `/dropFlag` for game logic testing and management.
- Players interact with GUIs for team, class, and server selection.
